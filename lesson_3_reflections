    perhaps when you are working with pther people.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    you may be working with multiple contributors and things might get hairy if its automatic
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    forks is a copy of someone elses shit that you can edit, clone is a copy of a project between two computers, branch is a branch of commits
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

     so that you can compare that to progress you've made locally
	 
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

     using emails and dropbox and whatever, it would be a bit tedious
	 
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

     perhps when working on an experimental feature. separete branches allow you to go off on tangents while the master is faster to work with.

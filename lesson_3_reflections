When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    perhaps when you are working with pther people.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    you may be working with multiple contributors and things might get hairy if its automatic
